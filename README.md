# ðŸ”’ DevHttps

**Easy https for local web development**

---

DevHttps automatically generates a https certificate,  and configures and runs
[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as a https reverse proxy.

**Benefits:**

- Nice URLs: e.g. `https://dev.yourapp.com` instead of `http://localhost:3000`
- Develop with https features e.g. secure cookies
- No need to disable security checks for non-https development
- Catch https related issues before deploying to production


## Quickstart:

(1) Install DevHttps and Caddy webserver:

```shell
brew install devhttps caddy
```


(2) Choose a subdomain for development e.g. `dev.yourapp.com`:

- Use a domain you control - you must be able to edit DNS entries!


(3) Configure DevHttps for your chosen domain:
  - Use your chosen subdomain
  - Use the development port for your app (e.g. 3000 for node)
  - Create the 2 DNS entries specified as instructed
```shell
devhttps add --start dev.myapp.com 3000

# (create DNS entries as shown by the command)
```

(4) Enjoy https in development:
```shell
open "https://dev.myapp.com/"
```
(Don't forget to start your app e.g. "npm run dev")
